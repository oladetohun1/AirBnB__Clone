# Description of the Project

The goal of this project is to deploy a replica of the [Airbnb website](https://www.airbnb.com/)  on my server. All features won't be implemented.
After 4 months, we will have a complete web application composed by:

- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
